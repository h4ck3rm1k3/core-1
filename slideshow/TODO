Stuff left doing
================

 - remove extraneous throw specs from canvas and slideshow - or does
   that break dbgutil builds?
 - grep for TODO-NYI
 - migrate emf+ renderer over to primitives
 - implement stateful canvas processor (e.g. for the color changes?)
   -or- decorate primitives with color modifiers e.g.
 - do we need viewstate at the canvas to pass around?

 - how much of the wrapper state in cppcanvas _was_ actually useful?
 - review canvas api - e.g. for the createBitmap / createSprite
   methods, is anyone *not* creating a Size struct on the fly?
